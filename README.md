## Business Objectives
This is aimed at analysing quantitatively and tracking the percentage of Covid-19 vaccine dosage globally.
Also to build a Covid Vaccine Tracker to track how the vaccination program is performing worldwide.

## Data Cleaning
Loading in the data country vaccination.
Designing all the worksheet:
-KPI 1 People who are partially vaccinated
-KPI 2 People who are fully vaccinated
-KPI 3- Calculated field for share of people who are not vaccinated over the population
-Calculated field for share of people who are fully vaccinated over the population and I represented it with a bar chat
Map of vaccination per hundred
Vaccinated over the GDP per capita showing the correlation

## Data Visualization
I worked on the filters in order to get an interactive dashboard.
Showed the filter for the country, continent and added the date parameter to filter the country by date.
Added all the worksheets to the dashboard and finally got an interactive dashboard (Global Vaccine Tracker).
